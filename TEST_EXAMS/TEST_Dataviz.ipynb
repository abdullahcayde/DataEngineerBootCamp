    "\n",
    "    Note: Normalization is a very common practice in Data Science and Data Analysis. It consists of changing the data range of variables so that variables can be compared to each other. For example, the selling prices of a housing and the living areas have two distinct ranges of values (from 10,000 to several million for the selling price of a housing in euros and from 5 to 500 for the living area in m²). The most common Machine Learning algorithms assume normalized data as input. You will see this data preprocessing step in more detail in the following modules!\n",

    "    We will focus on the distribution of GrLivArea, which represents the living area. This distribution seems very similar to that of SalePrice. We will therefore compare these distributions between the living area and the prices of the houses in the studied dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the following questions, we will try to superimpose these two distributions and conclude on the advantages and limitations of histograms in the study of inter-variable correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Warning: the ranges of values taken by the variables SalePrice and GrLivArea are different. It is therefore necessary to normalize those Series in order to compare their distribution and draw relevant correlation conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: Normalization is a very common practice in Data Science and Data Analysis. It consists of changing the data range of variables so that variables can be compared to each other. For example, the selling prices of a housing and the living areas have two distinct ranges of values (from 10,000 to several million for the selling price of a housing in euros and from 5 to 500 for the living area in m²). The most common Machine Learning algorithms assume normalized data as input. You will see this data preprocessing step in more detail in the following modules!\n",

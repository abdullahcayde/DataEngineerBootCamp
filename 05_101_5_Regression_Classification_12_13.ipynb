    "Objective of classification\n",
    "\n",
    "    In supervised learning, the objective is to predict the value of a target variable from explanatory variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "            In a regression problem, the target variable takes continuous values. These values are numerical: price of a house, quantity of oxygen in the air of a city, etc. The target variable can therefore take an infinity of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "            In a classification problem, the target variable takes discrete values. These values can be numeric or literal, but in both cases the target variable takes a finite number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The different values taken by the target variable are called classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The objective of classification therefore consists in predicting the class of an observation from its explanatory variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of classification\n",
    "\n",
    "    We will look at a problem of a binary classification, i.e. where there are two classes. We are trying to determine whether the water in a stream is drinkable or not depending on its concentration of toxic substances and its mineral salts content.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The two classes are therefore 'drinkable' and 'non-drinkable'.\n",

    "    In the figure above, each point represents a stream whose position on the map is defined by its values for the concentration of toxic substances and the content of mineral salts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The objective will be to build a model capable of assigning one of the two classes ('drinkable' / 'non-drinkable') to a stream of which only these two variables are known.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The figure above suggests the existence of two zones allowing easy classification of streams:\n",
    "\n",
    "            An area where the streams are drinkable (top left).\n",
    "\n",
    "            An area where the streams are not drinkable (bottom right).\n",
    "\n",
    "    We would like to create a model capable of separating the dataset into two parts corresponding to these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A simple technique would be to separate the two areas using a line.\n",

    "    (a) Run the next cell to display the interactive figure.\n",

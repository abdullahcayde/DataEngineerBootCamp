    "3. Broadcasting between a matrix and a vector\n",

    "1. Format of a DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "    A DataFrame is in the form of a matrix whose rows and columns each have an index. Typically, columns are indexed by name and rows by unique identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A DataFrame is used to store a database. The different entries in the database (individuals, animals, objects, etc.) are the different lines and their features are the different columns:\n",
    "    \tName \tGender \tHeight \tAge\n",
    "    0 \tRobert \tM \t174 \t23\n",
    "    1 \tMark \tM \t182 \t40\n",
    "    2 \tAline \tF \t169 \t56\n",
    "\n",
    "            The DataFrame above groups together information on 3 individuals: the DataFrame therefore has 3 lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "            For each of these individuals, there are 4 variables (name, gender, height and age) : therefore, the DataFrame has 4 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The column containing the numbering of the lines is called the index and is not managed in the same way as other columns of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The index can be set by default (will follow the row numbering), defined with one (or several) of the columns of the DataFrame or even defined with a list that we specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: Default indexing (line numbering), you don't have to specify anything :\n",
    "    \tName \tGender \tHeight \tAge\n",
    "    0 \tRobert \tM \t174 \t23\n",
    "    1 \tMark \tM \t182 \t40\n",
    "    2 \tAline \tF \t169 \t56\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: Indexing by the column 'Name':\n",
    "    \tGender \tHeight \tAge\n",
    "    Robert \tM \t174 \t23\n",
    "    Mark \tM \t182 \t40\n",
    "    Aline \tF \t169 \t56\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: Indexing by the list ['person_1', 'person_2', 'person_3']:\n",
    "    \tName \tGender \tHeight \tAge\n",
    "    person_1 \tRobert \tM \t174 \t23\n",

    "\n",
    "            Within the same column the elements are of the same type but from one column to another, the type of the elements may vary, which is not the case of Numpy arrays which only support data of the same type.\n",

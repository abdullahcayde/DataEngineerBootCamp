    "1. Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "    A function in Python is a reusable block of code that is used to perform a specific operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We have already seen examples of built-in functions in Python such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "        The print function: Used to display an object.\n",
    "        The range function: Used to iterate through a series of integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We do not know the exact code inside these functions, yet we are able to predict their output. This is due to the fact that their result depends only on their parameters (or arguments) which are given to them as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The syntax to define a function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def my_function(parameter):\n",
    "        # Instruction block\n",
    "        ...\n",

    "        ...\n",
    "        # The result of the function is given by the variable a_value\n",
    "        return a_value\n",
    "\n",
    "    The keyword return defines the result of the function. This keyword also ends the execution of the function once the Python Interpreter encounters it. Everything that follows in the definition of the function will not be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # We define a function that determines whether a number is even or odd\n",
    "    def is_even(number):\n",
    "        # Is the number even?\n",

    "        else:\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "\n",
    "    This function takes as argument a number which will be stored in a temporary variable named number. When the function finishes its execution, the variable number is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once a function is defined, we can evaluate it by specifying the values of its parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(is_even(number = 3))\n",
    "    >>> False\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    We count this way until there are only 2 people left. In this case there is only one possible handshake left.\n",

    " Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "    In Python and many other programming languages, object-oriented programming consists in creating classes of objects that contain specific information and tools suitable for their manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    All the tools that we use for Data Science and that you will see later (numpy arrays, pandas DataFrames, scikit-learn models, matplotlib figures, ...) are built this way. Understanding the mechanics behind Python objects and knowing how to use them is essential to make the most of these tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "    An object class contains 3 fundamental elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "        A constructor: a function that initializes an object of the class.\n",
    "        Attributes: Variables specific to the created object used to define its properties and store information.\n",
    "        Methods: Class-specific functions that allow you to interact with an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To understand object classes, let us make an analogy with a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cars are a class of objects designating motorized and wheeled vehicles intended for land transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Assume that the constructor of the class of cars is a factory which produces them. From the attributes desired for the car such as its color, its model or its horsepower, the factory must be able to produce a car that matches the given specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Thus, the factory is analogous to a function which takes as argument the attributes of the car and returns the car built and ready to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    The methods of the car are the commands to accelerate or brake the vehicle. These commands are analogous to functions which take as argument the pressure on the pedal and apply an acceleration to the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In Python, a class is defined with the class keyword. This keyword allows us to start a block of code where we can define the constructor of the class and its methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The definition of the constructor is done with the method named __init__ which allows us to initialize the attributes of the object that is being built (note that this method takes two underscores before and after init):\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Definition of the Car class\n",
    "    class Car:\n",
    "    # Definition of the constructor of the Car class\n",
    "        def __init__(self, color, model, horsepower):\n",
    "    # Initialization of the attributes of the class with the arguments of the constructor\n",
    "            self.color = color\n",
    "            self.model = model\n",
    "            self.horsepower = horsepower\n",
    "\n",
    "    The self argument corresponds to the object calling the method. This argument allows us to access the attributes of the object within the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    All the methods of a class must have as first argument in their definition the argument self because the methods of a class systematically receive the object which calls them as the first argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We can define other methods within this class:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Definition of the Car class\n",
    "    class Car:\n",
    "         # Definition of the constructor of the Car class\n",
    "        def __init__(self, color, model, horsepower):\n",
    "            # Initialization of the attributes of the class with the arguments of the constructor\n",
    "            self.color = color\n",
    "            self.model = model\n",
    "            self.horsepower = horsepower\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Definition of a method to change the color of a car\n",
    "        def change_color(self, new_color):\n",
    "           self.color = new_color\n",
    "\n",
    "    To create an object of this class, we must use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Creation of an object of the Car class\n",
    "    aventador = Car(color = \"orange\",\n",
    "                    model = \"Aventador\",\n",
    "                    horsepower = 700)\n",
    "\n",
    "    To create the object, Car is used as a function. Python is actually calling the __init__ method of the Car class, giving it the arguments we passed when calling the Car 'function'. This is why we also call the Car() function the constructor of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The process of building an object and assigning it to a variable is called instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We say that aventador is an instance of the Car class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking inspiration from the Car class defined above:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (a) Define a new Complex class with 2 attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "            part_re which contains the real part of a Complex number.\n",
    "            part_im which contains the imaginary part of a Complex number.\n",

    "\n",
    "    This method must be adapted to the sign of the imaginary part (The display should yield 4 - 2i,6 + 2i, 5).\n",
    "\n",

    "    Modules are easily shareable and in general modules specialize in very specific tasks such as:\n",

    "\n",
    "            Optimized computation (numpy)\n",

    "\n",
    "            Machine learning (scikit-learn)\n",
    "\n",
    "    All the Data Science tasks that you will learn in your training rely on modules written by other developers. These modules are among the greatest assets of the Python language and the absence of these modules would make Python a sub-optimal language for Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are many programming languages which are fundamentally superior to Python. However, as long as the modules we use are not available in those languages, it will be very difficult to migrate.\n",

    "\n",
    "    # The 'cos' function of numpy allows you to compute the cosine of a number\n",
    "    print(numpy.cos(x))\n",
    "    >>> 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is not very practical to have to write numpy every time we want to use a function from this module. For that, we can abbreviate its name using the keyword as:\n",

    "    # We import numpy and we abbreviate its name with 'np'\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",

    "    We say that np is the alias ofnumpy.\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "    numpy (for Numerical Python) is a very advanced digital library for handling large multidimensional arrays and high level mathematical routines (linear algebra, statistics, complex mathematical functions, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "    The object class that we will mainly manipulate is the array class of numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    These arrays correspond to N-dimensional matrices which can contain very diverse data such as tabular data, time series or images.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The interest of the numpy module lies in the possibility of applying operations on these arrays in a very efficient way, i.e. the number of lines of code required and the computational time to perform these operations will be very reduced compared to a traditional Python syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating a numpy array\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unlike usual classes you will see in your training, a numpy array can be instantiated with many different constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The argument of these constructors is usually a tuple containing the desired matrix dimensions. This tuple is called the shape of an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Import of the numpy module under the alias 'np'\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Creating a matrix of dimensions 5x10 filled with zeros\n",
    "    X = np.zeros(shape = (5, 10))\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Creating a 3-dimensional 3x10x10 matrix filled with ones\n",
    "    X = np.ones(shape = (3, 10, 10))\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is also possible to create an array from a list using the np.array constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Creating an array from a list defined by comprehension\n",
    "    X = np.array([2*i for i in range(10)]) # 0, 2, 4, 6, ..., 18\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create an array from a list of lists\n",
    "    X = np.array([[1, 3, 3],\n",
    "                  [3, 3, 1],\n",
    "                  [1, 2, 0]])\n",
    "\n",
    "    These three constructors are only examples. We will see other constructors later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Indexation of a numpy array\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unlike lists, a numpy array is multidimensional. Indexing must be done by entering the index that we want to access on each dimension:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Creating a matrix of dimensions 10x10 filled with ones\n",
    "    X = np.ones(shape = (10, 10))\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Displaying element at index (4, 3)\n",
    "    print(X[4, 3])\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Assigning the value -1 to the element of index (1, 5)\n",
    "    X[1, 5] = -1\n",
    "\n",
    "    As with all other Python indexable objects, the starting index of an axis is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    As for lists, it is possible to index an array using slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is possible to slice on each dimension of an array. In the following example, we will extract a subarray from X using slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The previous examples illustrate the indexing of a 2-dimensional array, but this type of indexing can be generalized on N-dimensional arrays. It is also possible to use the negative indexing as for lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "    (a) Using constructors and array slicing, create and display the following diagonal block matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "array([[ 1.,  1.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n",

    "3. Reshaping an array\n",
    "\n",
    "    The shape of an array corresponds to its dimensions. Resizing an array is known as reshaping.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It happens that an array is not of the appropriate dimensions to be visualized or processed with machine learning algorithms which often can only process vectors and not matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Thus, it is possible to use the reshape method of an array to reconstruct the data of the array with different dimensions. The argument of the reshape method is the shape we want to obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create an array from a list of 10 elements\n",
    "    X = np.array([i for i in range(1, 11)]) # 1, 2, ..., 10\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Displaying the dimensions of X\n",
    "    print(X.shape)\n",
    "    >>> (10,)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Displaying X\n",
    "    print(X)\n",
    "    >>> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Reshaping the array into a matrix with 2 rows and 5 columns \n",
    "    X_reshaped = X.reshape((2, 5))\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Displaying the new array\n",
    "    print(X_reshaped)\n",
    "    >>> [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n",
    "    >>>  [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is possible to resize an array to any shape as long as both shapes have the same number of elements. In the previous example, the array X contains 10 elements and the shape we desire too (2 x 5 = 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the following, we will briefly explore the digits dataset from the scikit-learn module, a Python library used for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The digits dataset contains 1797 images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9. The objective of this dataset is to find a machine learning algorithm able to read handwritten numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The images in this dataset have a resolution of 8x8 pixels in gray scale.\n",
